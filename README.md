# Ticket Reservation System

## Overview

Welcome to the Ticket Reservation System project! This system is designed for a large movie theater chain, enabling users to browse movies, select showtimes, reserve seats, and make payments. The UI/UX is already designed, and a series of backend APIs are available for integration.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:


## Requirements

The Ticket Reservation System has the following key requirements:

1. **User Functionality:**
   - Users should be able to browse movies and view showtimes for each movie.
   - Users should be able to select a showtime and reserve seats.
   - The system should prevent double bookings for the same seat.

2. **Reservation and Payment:**
   - Users should be able to enter payment details and complete the reservation.

3. **Administrative Functionality:**
   - Administrators should have a management interface to add/edit movies, showtimes, and seating configurations.

## Instructions

1. **Clone repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ticket-reservation-system.git
cd ticket-reservation-system
```

2. **Initialize application**
Set up a frontend application using your preferred frontend framework (Angular, React, Vue.js or other). This can be an existing structured project that you use to start all your projects. It can be a starter project generated by cli.  Whatever your preference is... 

3. **Create basic app structure**
Create components that you feel represent the project, from page components to common components, libraries or utils etc.  Feel free to be creative here.  There's no right answer to how the structure is setup. Just use whatever best-practices that you've used in past projects and whatever you feel fits the framework used and the requirements as they are presented. The structure itself can be very rough, composed of just basic routing and empty frontend components.   Feel free to go as far as you want with the requirements but leave enough time for the next step.  

4. **Write functional code**
Pick one specific feature from the list above (e.g., seat selection logic) and write an outline of functions required to implement this feature. Pick one of the functions and write some of the code.  Feel free to write a very rough outline of the function code, as long as you're able to explain your logic around it. 

5 **Commit changes**
Create a new branch and push the branch to origin.   Create a PR against the main branch and write any comments that you feel describe the work that you've just done.
Feel free to add me as a reviewer. 


## Expectations
The exercise is expected to take roughly an hour.   Within an hour, it's understood that there's not a lot of time to do all that's being proposed. The exercise is purposely written so that there's a time-constraint and is meant to test interpretation and prioritization.   But please don't feel bad if there's problems with the execution of the application or incomplete functions.
